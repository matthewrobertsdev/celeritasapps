      SwiftUI Design is an interactive app for designing SwiftUI 
      views, controls, layouts, and navigation structures and then 
      seeing the code necessary to create them.  It lets you configure 
      and preview built-in Views with easy controls for configuring them 
      to better be able to create your app or apps.  It shows you the 
      code to achieve what you have designed in the app.
